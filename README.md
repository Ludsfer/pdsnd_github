### Date created
This project is created on **December 16, 2021**

### Project Title
**Post _bikeshare.py_ on Github**

### Description
The project mainly aims at **Exploring** and _computing_ various statistics of the bike sharing system data corresponding to the requested city, month(s) and day(s) within a timestamp spanning from January to June 2017
A summary of the statistics includes:

- The Most frequent times of travel
- The Most Popular Stations and Trip
- Statistics on bikeshare users type
- Statistics on the total and average trip duration
- statistics on the longuest, shortest name of each station
- Set up code composed of the first three letters of user type month and day and check for the number of possible combination in the loaded filtered data
- Statistics of the number of station in the loaded data that starts with a letter or digit
- Distribution of the Gender and trip duration

### Files used
There are data (files) for **3** different cities: 'chicago', 'new york city', 'washington'
